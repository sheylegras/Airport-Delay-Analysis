# **Airport Delay Analysis**
A Python based project of arrival flight delay reasons as part of CareerFoundry Data Analysis immersion course.
## **Objective**
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The analysis team was tasked with performing an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
## **Data**
The dataset for this project consist of 2020-2021 open source data on airline on time statistics and delay causes. Delay cause explanations can be found below. And the original data can be found [here.](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20=E) 
- Carrier: The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within the airline's control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.)
- Weather: Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane.
- National Aviation System (NAS): Delays and cancellations attributable to the national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.
- Late Aircraft: A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.
- Security: Delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.
## **Tools**
For this project Excel, the following Python tools and libraries, and Tableau were used:
- Anaconda 3
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas was used for data analysis
- Seaborn was used for visualizations
